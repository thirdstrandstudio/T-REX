Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/_testContracts/v_3_5_2/LegacyToken_3_5_2.sol\":\"InitializableLegacy\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@onchain-id/solidity/contracts/=lib/onchain-id-solidity/contracts/\",\":@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/\",\":@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/\",\":ds-test/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\",\":erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/\",\":forge-std/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/forge-std/src/\",\":halmos-cheatcodes/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/halmos-cheatcodes/src/\",\":onchain-id-solidity/=lib/onchain-id-solidity/contracts/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\"]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/_testContracts/v_3_5_2/LegacyToken_3_5_2.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x3528b5c299f9b35eff7bf3b13304d805dbc76dc002b5924a01667e97d4ad41b6\",\"license\":\"GPL-3.0\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0dfa3a6b439ca20d698f9e1d383fdba76aa4e451ec646d3a3ec7ad2803f62f74\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmbwj4g6vqXwHzcJzCh2EuCUDmG6E2qzC2mkfqYF34BnXZ\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.28+commit.7893614a"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@onchain-id/solidity/contracts/=lib/onchain-id-solidity/contracts/","@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/","@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/","ds-test/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/","erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/","forge-std/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/forge-std/src/","halmos-cheatcodes/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/halmos-cheatcodes/src/","onchain-id-solidity/=lib/onchain-id-solidity/contracts/","openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/","openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"contracts/_testContracts/v_3_5_2/LegacyToken_3_5_2.sol":"InitializableLegacy"},"evmVersion":"paris","libraries":{}},"sources":{"contracts/_testContracts/v_3_5_2/LegacyToken_3_5_2.sol":{"keccak256":"0x3528b5c299f9b35eff7bf3b13304d805dbc76dc002b5924a01667e97d4ad41b6","urls":["bzz-raw://0dfa3a6b439ca20d698f9e1d383fdba76aa4e451ec646d3a3ec7ad2803f62f74","dweb:/ipfs/Qmbwj4g6vqXwHzcJzCh2EuCUDmG6E2qzC2mkfqYF34BnXZ"],"license":"GPL-3.0"}},"version":1},"id":10}
